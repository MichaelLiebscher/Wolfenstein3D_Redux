# Wolfenstein 3-D Redux
Wolfenstein 3-D Redux is about the preservation of id Software's archetypal First Person Shooter Wolfenstein 3-D. The restoration involved the removal of the gangrenous 16-bit code, while adding support for a number of new technologies. This was done to ensure that Wolfenstein 3-D and Spear of Destiny will be enjoyed for years to come.
